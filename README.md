# robotframework-crossbrowsertesting
This is a demo project to show how to use [Crossbrowsertesting](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/) with Robot Framework.
The idea is to take a video of the test while your tests are running.

For more information about Robot Framework, please see [robotframework.org](http://robotframework.org/).
For more information about Crossbrowsertesting, please see [crossbrowsertesting.com](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/)

I have included the CBT file in my Resources folder for reference, but you can get your own copy from the **Automation Examples** section of [Automation Getting Started page.](https://app.crossbrowsertesting.com/selenium/run)

### Pre-requisites
- You'll need to have Automation enabled on your CBT plan
- You'll need to install the Requests library
    ```bash
    pip install -U requests
    pip install -U robotframework-requests
    ```
  For more information, please see [their official page](https://github.com/bulkan/robotframework-requests/)
